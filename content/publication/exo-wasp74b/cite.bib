	abstract = {WASP-74b is an exoplanet in one of the brighter systems accessible to Southern telescope. We report the analysis of light curve from the transit event of WASP-74b observed at Bosscha Observatory. This report is focused on deriving physical parameters from a single transit lightcurve of WASP-74b at around JD 2457597.14 using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler (MCMC) and simple trends model. Physical parameters of the system are successfully derived, in agreement with the discovery paper which uses data from longer monitoring and more thorough observation.}
