	abstract = {We present the preliminary result of exoplanet survey observation of NGC 6494 and NGC 6633 at Bosscha Observatory. This research is part of a long-term program of exoplanet survey observations in the open star cluster near the celestial equator. Transit method is used to detect planets orbiting stars in the open star clusters. We are using the 11 inch diameter telescope and targeting transit depth up to 0.01 magnitudes. So far, we still do not detect transiting exoplanets. However, we detect several stars showing variability in its flux resembling the characteristic of variable star. Follow up observation would be needed to identify the type of variable stars.}
