# Abstract.
abstract = "Using the data taken from our 0.36 m f/7.2 robotic telescope, we performed a very first light curve (LC) analyses of eclipsing binary ASAS 172533-1221.4, one of target stars which is part of program stars in our variable star survey project. The LC of this star was constructed by using $\\texttt{LEMON}$, a semi-automatic photometric pipeline written in Python. We refined a Time of Minima (ToM, $T_ 0$) and variability period of this system, $P$ and updated its ephemerides as min I (HJD) = 2457200.255578 + 0.678861 $\\times$ E. The LC modeling of the system was conducted with the $\\texttt{PHOEBE}$ (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs) software built on top of the widely used WD program . The assorted LC modeling solutions are shown as follows: mass ratio $q = 0.811 \\pm 0.009$, inclination $i = 70.62 \\pm 0.01^\\circ$, temperature of primary and secondary component $T_ 1 = 5559.23 \\pm 83.51$ K and $T_ 2 = 3871.64 \\pm 43.66$ K, respectively, and modified Kopal potentials which are a function of primary's and secondary's radii $\\Omega_ 1 = 3.436 \\pm 0.018$ and $\\Omega_ 2 = \\Omega_ \\mathrm{cr} = 2.980$, respectively. It is concluded that ASAS 1725533-1221.4 is found to be near-contact system with almost similar size between primary and secondary components, with its secondary component is already filling its Roche lobe."
