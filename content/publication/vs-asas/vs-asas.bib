	abstract = {Using the data taken from our 0.36 m f/7.2 robotic telescope, we performed a very first light curve (LC) analyses of eclipsing binary ASAS 172533-1221.4, one of target stars which is part of program stars in our variable star survey project. The LC of this star was constructed by using LEMON, a semi-automatic photometric pipeline written in Python. We refined a Time of Minima (ToM, T
0) and variability period of this system, P and updated its ephemerides as HJD(min I) = 2457200.255578 + 0.678861 * ϕ. The LC modeling of the system was conducted with the PHOEBE (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs) software built on top of the widely used WD program . The assorted LC modeling solutions are shown as follows: mass ratio q = 0.811 ± 0.009, inclination i = 70.62 ± 0.01°, temperature of primary and secondary component T
1 = 5559.23 ± 83.51 K and T
2 = 3871.64 ± 43.66 K, respectively, and modified Kopal potentials which are a function of primary’s and secondary’s radii Ω1 = 3.436 ± 0.018 and Ω2 = Ocr = 2.980, respectively. It is concluded that ASAS 1725533-1221.4 is found to be near-contact system with almost similar size between primary and secondary components, with its secondary component is already filling its Roche lobe.}
