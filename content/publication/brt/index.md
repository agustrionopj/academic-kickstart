# Abstract.
abstract = "We introduce the second generation of the Bosscha Robotic Telescope (BRT), a remotely and automatically operated 0.35-meter telescope. This paper will describe the BRT technical properties, system, and the data from early observations. We have been working on the robotic automation of the telescope system in order to be ready for the national observatory along with international telescope networks. The use of the telescope includes monitoring observation of variable stars, exoplanet, near earth asteroid; and observational for education."
