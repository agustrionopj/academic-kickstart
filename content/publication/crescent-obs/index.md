# Abstract.
abstract = "Bosscha Observatory, Institut Teknologi Bandung, has been experimenting to observe crescent moon using small telescope equipped with digital cameras since 2007. The initial motivation was to provide evidence, i.e. digital image, of the first crescent moon visible after new moon (hilal) for moslem community in determining the first day of Ramadan and Shawwal. Initially, observation was done after sunset, following common believe that crescent moon can be detected only after glare from the Sun disappear. In early 2000's it was shown that crescent moon can be detected using CCD camera before sunset (in daylight) with special setup. We catched up the idea in 2013. In this paper we summarize what we have learned so far. Now, detection of crescent moon with elongation e > 4Â° is not a problem. Detailed report will be written somewhere else."
